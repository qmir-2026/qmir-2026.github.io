qmd preview error (something with "Deno") -> close / delete current terminal session and click preview again
-> most of the times works now
-> delete .quarto or .freeze folders
-> else manually type quarto render [file], as preview does much more complicated stuff behind the scenes


Quarto works in the following order:
    -> is YAML correct?
    -> are code cell options correct?
    -> evaluate code
    -> "knit" together code, code output and markdown text
    -> render to desired output
