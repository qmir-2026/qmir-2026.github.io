    "text": "Feeling overwhelmed is normal (and expected)\nEncountering many tools at once can feel complex and, at times, overwhelming. This is entirely normal and an expected part of the learning process. Modern research environments evolve quickly, with new libraries, platforms, and technologies (including AI-based tools) constantly emerging. One of the central goals of this course is therefore not just to teach specific tools, but to help you develop the ability to learn how to learn programming and computational methods — an essential and transferable skill for any data-driven career."

They also help you document decisions, protocol analytical steps, collaborate with others, and build workflows that can be extended, reproduced, and scaled. In this sense, the course aims to familiarize you with research practices that more closely resemble how high-quality empirical work is actually conducted."

    "text": "Learning concepts, not just commands\nGiven the scope of the course, we will inevitably only scratch the surface — the “tip of the iceberg” — of many of these tools. However, I will emphasize conceptual understanding: how the tools work in principle, why they are useful, and in which situations they are beneficial. This foundation is designed to enable you to work independently and confidently with these (and future) tools beyond the course."

There is no single “correct” way to code or to structure an analysis, and many different approaches can lead to the same goal. Pragmatism matters: tools should serve your research questions, not the other way around."

While not all tools will be used in the first week, I strongly recommend installing everything as early as possible. This gives us time to troubleshoot potential issues and ensures that technical setup does not become a bottleneck once we move into substantive work."
