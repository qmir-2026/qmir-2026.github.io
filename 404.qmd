# 404: Page Not Found

🚫 Oops! This page must have taken a wrong turn in the workflow.  

It might be:  
- Like an R function that hasn’t been loaded yet,  
- Lost somewhere between your working directory and GitHub, or  
- Hiding behind a very aggressive `if (!exists("page")) stop("404")`  

Don’t worry — your data is safe, and your sanity probably is too.  
Try going back to the [home page](/), or check your URL — sometimes even the best reproducible workflows hit a missing file.  

💡 Pro tip: In R, if you see `NA`, it doesn’t mean the object doesn’t exist. But here… well, it does.
