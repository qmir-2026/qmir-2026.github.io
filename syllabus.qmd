## Course Description

This course introduces students to quantitative research methods in international relations and European integration using modern tools for scientific programming and reproducible research. Students will learn how to analyze and visualize data in R, document their work using Quarto, and manage their projects efficiently using Git and GitHub. These tools enable students to follow state-of-the-art workflows for transparent, collaborative, and well-organized empirical research. All work will be conducted in Positron, an integrated development environment for data science.

## Course Objectives

The overall goal of the course is to equip students with the practical skills and methodological confidence necessary to write an empirical bachelor thesis in political science. Students will learn how to preprocess data, select and implement appropriate statistical models for continuous and binary outcomes, compute quantities of interest, and interpret results accurately. Beyond technical proficiency, the course emphasizes sound statistical reasoning, effective data visualization, and the clear communication of empirical findings in a way that is accessible to nontechnical audiences. Through regular assignments and a cumulative final project (take-home exam), students will develop the ability to critically evaluate statistical claims in both academic research and public discourse, providing a solid foundation for conducting their own empirical analyses.

## Course Logistics

### General Information

Each session consists of an instructor-led lecture on concepts and theory, followed by hands-on exercises. Homework is assigned at the end of class and due one week later. Readings provide background, theory, and context for the session. Because homework deadlines are tied to class days, students should remain in their assigned group (Mon or Thu) as their main class. Attending the other day is allowed in case of sickness or other exceptions, but this should remain the exception rather than the norm.

### Attendance Policy

Active participation (*Mitarbeit*) is a required component of the coursework (*Studienleistung*). This course consists of 13 class sessions. Successful participation is presumed if a student attends at least **80% of class sessions (at least 11 out of 13 sessions)**.

If attendance falls below 80% but remains at or above 60% (**8–10 out of 13 sessions**), successful participation is not presumed; in such cases, the possibility of fulfilling the participation requirement will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

If attendance falls below 60% (**fewer than 8 out of 13 sessions**), successful participation is normally considered impossible under the examination regulations.

If class sessions are cancelled during the semester, the absolute number of required sessions will be adjusted accordingly while the percentage thresholds (80% and 60%) remain unchanged.


### Grading Policy

According to the examination regulations, course assessment consists of **coursework (*Studienleistung*, pass/fail)** and a **final examination (*Prüfungsleistung*, graded)**.

Successful completion of all coursework requirements is a prerequisite for admission to the final take-home exam.

#### Coursework (*Studienleistung*, pass/fail)

Coursework consists of two components:

**1. Weekly Homework Assignments**  
Starting in Week 2 (no homework will be assigned in the final week of the semester), students must complete **11 weekly homework assignments**. Assignments will be distributed via GitHub and assessed on a pass/fail basis.

To fulfill this requirement, students must pass at least **80% of the assignments (9 out of 11 homeworks)**. Homework must demonstrate a serious and complete attempt at solving the tasks. Submissions that are empty or clearly insufficient will not be counted as passed.

**2. Active Participation (*Mitarbeit*)**  
Active participation, as described in the Attendance Policy, is a required coursework component and will be assessed on a pass/fail basis.

Both components must be passed in order to fulfill the *Studienleistung* requirement.

#### Final Examination (*Prüfungsleistung*, graded)

The final examination consists of a **take-home exam**, currently scheduled for:

**May 28, 19:00 — June 05, 23:59**

The exam will be distributed via GitHub. You will receive a dataset and a problem description for a cumulative data analysis project.

You must submit a complete project repository (project folder) via GitHub. The repository must include:

- Fully documented and reproducible code  
- A rendered PDF file presenting your results (structured similarly to a data, methods, and analysis section of a research paper)  
- All relevant LLM chat history(ies), if AI tools were used
- A statutory declaration according to the [University's guidelines](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/media/Fakultaeten/sowi/Dokumente/Studiengangsmanagement/Eigenstaendigkeitserklaerung_Statutory_Declaration.pdf)

The version of the repository available on GitHub at the moment the deadline passes will be evaluated.

The take-home exam will be graded according to the university grading scale (1.0 = very good to 5.0 = insufficient) and determines the overall course grade.

All tools and workflows necessary to complete the exam will be taught during the course.

### Language and Software Policy

The course is taught entirely in English and focuses on using R, Quarto, and Git/GitHub for data analysis, reproducible research, and project management. Students are encouraged to work with these tools, as the course exercises and workflows are designed around them. For the take-home exam, students may use other script-based languages (e.g., Python or Stata), but this is not recommended, and no guidance will be provided for non-R workflows. The emphasis is on understanding the tools, practicing them, and learning how to independently find solutions.

### Hardware

You are required to have a computer available during class. For the purposes of this course, a standard laptop is sufficient; there are no specific requirements regarding RAM, external GPUs, or other advanced hardware components.

If you do not own a suitable device, the University of Mannheim’s IT department offers a [laptop rental service](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/it/students/borrowing-laptops/). Students are encouraged to make use of this option if needed.


### Software

Please install all required software programs and tools following the separate [installation guide](installation.qmd) before the first session, so we can address any potential issues on that day and fully start the programming part in the subsequent lecture.

### Optional Practice Materials

It is highly recommended that you take advantage of the access to DataCamp provided by this course. DataCamp is an online learning platform offering valuable opportunities to practice the material covered in this course and beyond. A good starting point is the Introduction to R tutorial. DataCamp courses are voluntary and not part of the mandatory requirements to pass the course.

### Late Work Policy

Late submissions will not be accepted. If you anticipate any difficulties in meeting a deadline, you must discuss this issue with me before the deadline, not after.

### AI Policy

All submissions will be checked for plagiarism, and violations of the code of conduct may result in failing the course or expulsion. While generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or Gemini, are permitted for the final examination, any AI-generated content or code must be clearly highlighted, thoroughly commented, and accompanied by the chat history to demonstrate understanding. I will (try to) occasionally provide guidance on using AI responsibly, but relying on it from the start can hinder learning; [research shows AI is most effective for those who already understand the topic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03102). For a detailed explanation of why AI can undermine learning, see [this explanation by Andrew Heiss](https://governancef25.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus.html#ai-large-language-models-and-bullshit).

### Mental Health Support

Life and learning at the University of Mannheim can sometimes feel complicated, challenging, or even overwhelming. This is completely normal. You are not expected to fully understand—or memorize—course content on the first attempt. If you ever feel mentally or emotionally strained, you may find helpful advice on the [University of Mannheim's Good Mental Health and Studying page](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/academics/studying-the-healthy-way/good-mental-health/). Additionally, the [Help in Times of Crises page](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/academics/studying-the-healthy-way/help-in-times-of-crisis/) provides an overview of the various counseling and support services available at the university.
